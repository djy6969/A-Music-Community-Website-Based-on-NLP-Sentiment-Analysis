# A-Music-Community-Website-Based-on-NLP-Sentiment-Analysis

Abstract
This project aims to solve the lack of social media features on current music platforms, the
expensive and slow manual collection of user feedback, and the reluctance of users to provide
feedback. The method used was to combine a music player with a social media platform to create
an online music community website based on efficient web-development technologies. Additionally,
an NLP model was employed to automatically and effectively collect user feedback based on
sentiment analysis techniques.

The results of this project are a successful development of an online music community platform
where users can enjoy music with music enthusiasts. The platform also provides music companies
with visualized results of user feedback sentiment and trends of popular music.

The project’s conclusion is that this platform provides a possible solution for music companies
seeking to improve their commercial merits by increasing user engagement. Overall, this project
demonstrates the potential for the integration of social media features and NLP techniques to
enhance user engagement and improve commercial success in the music industry.

Introduction
User feedback is crucial for internet businesses. However, the traditional way of collecting user
feedback is not comprehensive enough and users are not proactive in giving feedback. With the
continuous development of NLP technology, large language models have gained the ability to
efficiently and accurately analyze and understand user feedback. Thus, we aim to apply NLP
sentiment analysis technology to a social media web application in our project, allowing platform
managers to better understand user preferences and emotions. This will help them adjust product
strategies accordingly, better meet user needs, attract more customers, and provide more benefits
for the platform.

At the same time, most music streaming platforms currently lack social features. We innovatively
combine the music player and user community in our project, allowing users to communicate with
other music enthusiasts through social interaction, and to establish deeper social relationships by
enjoying music together. This enhances the user experience, strengthens user preferences for our
music community platform, and ultimately increases potential consumption for our company.

To achieve this, we built a music community platform with NLP sentiment analysis functionality.
We created a fake traditional record company, Daring, which was the project’s client. At that
time, the company only released albums for offline sales. It didn’t have its own website, so fans
couldn’t access online music resources or the latest information easily. As a result, the business
marketing of the company may not have met the expected performance. Furthermore, fans didn’t
have a proper platform to share their thoughts on new songs. Finally, with the increase in total
customers, the original way of handling consumer feedback emails manually couldn’t efficiently
analyze the user’s requirements. The company required a more efficient and precise way to obtain
users’ preferences to make a future marketing strategy.

DMC (Daring Music Community), our music social platform, aims to solve the aforementioned issues by creating an online music community platform that provides users with more comprehensive
music services. In addition to allowing users to access the latest music resources and information,
the platform provides rich communication features, such as music discussion forums, posting, and
listening together functions. These features help users better explore music, and discover new
artists and music genres. Meanwhile, users can communicate and share experiences with other
music enthusiasts, thereby deepening user engagement with this music community.

Furthermore, the platform will collect user feedback on the company’s songs, including comments
and posts, as a basis for adjusting the company’s song sales strategy. This will help Daring better
understand users’ needs, so the company can apply music products and services that better cater
to users’ preferences and increase user satisfaction, thereby enhancing Daring’s commercial merits.
