# A-Music-Community-Website-Based-on-NLP-Sentiment-Analysis

This project aims to solve the lack of social media features on current music platforms, the
expensive and slow manual collection of user feedback, and the reluctance of users to provide
feedback. The method used was to combine a music player with a social media platform to create
an online music community website based on efficient web-development technologies. Additionally,
an NLP model was employed to automatically and effectively collect user feedback based on
sentiment analysis techniques.

The results of this project are a successful development of an online music community platform
where users can enjoy music with music enthusiasts. The platform also provides music companies
with visualized results of user feedback sentiment and trends of popular music.

The projectâ€™s conclusion is that this platform provides a possible solution for music companies
seeking to improve their commercial merits by increasing user engagement. Overall, this project
demonstrates the potential for the integration of social media features and NLP techniques to
enhance user engagement and improve commercial success in the music industry.
